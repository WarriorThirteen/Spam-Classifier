A single layer artificial neural network to classify spam emails.

The data is a collection of flags about data points in the email - i.e. does it contain capitalised words.

Part of a university coursework.

I am not sure if a multi-layer network using this implementation would train properly.
Multiple layers didnt seem to reach a higher accuracy in a reasonable time when I tested it so it didn't matter to the result.
